Ses05F_impro06_M000,What's wrong Melissa?
Ses05F_impro06_F000,A good friend of mine passed away the other day.
Ses05F_impro06_M001,"Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?"
Ses05F_impro06_F001,"Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,"
Ses05F_impro06_F002,"metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-"
Ses05F_impro06_M002,That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?
Ses05F_impro06_F003,Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.
Ses05F_impro06_F004,[BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_M003,"I am so sorry,  It's-"
Ses05F_impro06_M004,It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?
Ses05F_impro06_F005,Kind of.
Ses05F_impro06_F006,"It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know."
Ses05F_impro06_M005,"Absolutely, absolutely."
Ses05F_impro06_M006,It's the think
Ses05F_impro06_F007,"I just, I don't know."
Ses05F_impro06_M007,There's no reason for it.
Ses05F_impro06_F008,I know.
Ses05F_impro06_F009,And he could of...  He was pretty awesome
Ses05F_impro06_M008,Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?
Ses05F_impro06_F010,"Uh,  We grew up together."
Ses05F_impro06_M009,yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M010,"Is he an actor too, or-?"
Ses05F_impro06_F011,"Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes."
Ses05F_impro06_F012,"I feel really bad for his family, you know."
Ses05F_impro06_M011,"Yes of course, of course."
Ses05F_impro06_F013,"It must be really, really hard to lose a child."
Ses05F_impro06_M012,Was he very close to his family?
Ses05F_impro06_F014,"Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-"
Ses05F_impro06_M013,yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_F015,[BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F016,I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.
Ses05F_impro06_M014,Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.
Ses05F_impro06_F017,"Yeah, I'm just going to miss him."
Ses05F_impro06_M015,"Of course. If there's anything I can do, you just let me know.  Okay?"
Ses05F_impro06_F018,Thank you.
Ses05F_impro06_M016,Of course.
Ses05F_impro06_M017,Is there a funeral planned? or-
Ses05F_impro06_F019,"Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something."
Ses05F_impro06_M018,"Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will."
Ses05F_impro06_F020,Thanks.
Ses05F_impro06_M019,No problem.
Ses05F_impro06_F021,"It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then..."
Ses05F_impro06_F022,something happens and they die and it's like-
Ses05F_impro06_F023,"really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped."
Ses05F_impro06_M020,"Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real."
Ses05F_impro06_M021,yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_F024,[BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_M022,"Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess."
Ses05F_impro06_F025,yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M023,That's the best way to put it.
Ses05F_impro06_F026,It's hard to say good-bye.
Ses05F_impro06_M024,Absolutely.
Ses05F_impro06_F027,[BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_M025,"Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be."
Ses05F_impro06_F028,[LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro06_F029,yeah yeah.
