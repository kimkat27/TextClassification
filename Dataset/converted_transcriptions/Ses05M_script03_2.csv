Ses05M_script03_2_M000,Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.
Ses05M_script03_2_F000,Oh You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05M_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.
Ses05M_script03_2_F001,Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05M_script03_2_M002,"I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste."
Ses05M_script03_2_F002,Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
Ses05M_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses05M_script03_2_F003,"[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination."
Ses05M_script03_2_M004,You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?
Ses05M_script03_2_F004,"Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious."
Ses05M_script03_2_M005,He let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses05M_script03_2_F005,"Well, what of it."
Ses05M_script03_2_M006,what of it?
Ses05M_script03_2_F006,Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
Ses05M_script03_2_M007,What about me?
Ses05M_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it."
Ses05M_script03_2_M008,"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say."
Ses05M_script03_2_F008,I'm getting very bored with this conversation.
Ses05M_script03_2_M009,"Me, too, bored stiff."
Ses05M_script03_2_M010,Do you want some brandy?
Ses05M_script03_2_F009,No thanks.
Ses05M_script03_2_M011,I think I'll have a little.
Ses05M_script03_2_F010,I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.
Ses05M_script03_2_M012,"No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones."
Ses05M_script03_2_F011,"Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing."
Ses05M_script03_2_M013,You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.
Ses05M_script03_2_F012,It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05M_script03_2_M014,You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.
Ses05M_script03_2_F013,Don't be stupid.
Ses05M_script03_2_M015,"Amanda, really."
Ses05M_script03_2_F014,What?
Ses05M_script03_2_M016,"Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?"
Ses05M_script03_2_F015,Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05M_script03_2_M017,"Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart."
Ses05M_script03_2_F016,"It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?"
Ses05M_script03_2_M018,"Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true."
Ses05M_script03_2_F017,"No, it isn't."
Ses05M_script03_2_M019,"Yes, it is."
Ses05M_script03_2_F018,"No, it it is not, be quiet."
Ses05M_script03_2_M020,It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05M_script03_2_F019,"hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you."
Ses05M_script03_2_M021,"oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder."
Ses05M_script03_2_F020,"Adders don't snap, they sting."
Ses05M_script03_2_M022,"Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!"
Ses05M_script03_2_F021,They sting.
Ses05M_script03_2_M023,They snap.
Ses05M_script03_2_F022,"Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?"
Ses05M_script03_2_M024,"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?"
Ses05M_script03_2_F023,"Yes, I did quite a lot."
Ses05M_script03_2_M025,"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?"
Ses05M_script03_2_F024,[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.
Ses05M_script03_2_M026,"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway."
Ses05M_script03_2_F025,You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.
Ses05M_script03_2_M027,I am not the slightest bit drunk.
Ses05M_script03_2_F026,You always had a weak head.
Ses05M_script03_2_M028,I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
Ses05M_script03_2_F027,"Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass."
Ses05M_script03_2_M029,"Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?"
Ses05M_script03_2_F028,Not- Would you shut up.
Ses05M_script03_2_M030,"You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots."
Ses05M_script03_2_F029,"You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy."
Ses05M_script03_2_M031,You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
Ses05M_script03_2_M032,"You better turn that off, I think."
Ses05M_script03_2_F030,Why?
Ses05M_script03_2_M033,Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
Ses05M_script03_2_F031,There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.
Ses05M_script03_2_M034,"Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose."
Ses05M_script03_2_F032,They're away in Tunis.
Ses05M_script03_2_M035,This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses05M_script03_2_F033,"Turn it on again, please."
Ses05M_script03_2_M036,I do I shall do no such thing.
Ses05M_script03_2_F034,Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
Ses05M_script03_2_M037,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses05M_script03_2_F035,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses05M_script03_2_M038,Turn it off!
Ses05M_script03_2_F036,Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
Ses05M_script03_2_M039,Very amusing indeed.
Ses05M_script03_2_F037,"You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully."
Ses05M_script03_2_M040,Ja! Very funny.
Ses05M_script03_2_F038,"Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible."
Ses05M_script03_2_M041,"You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again."
Ses05M_script03_2_F039,This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
Ses05M_script03_2_M042,"Oh, you're not going like this."
Ses05M_script03_2_F040,"Yes, I am. Let go with me"
Ses05M_script03_2_M043,"[GARBAGE] No, you're not."
Ses05M_script03_2_F041,"You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!"
Ses05M_script03_2_M044,oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
Ses05M_script03_2_F042,Beast
Ses05M_script03_2_M045,You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.
Ses05M_script03_2_F043,Brute
Ses05M_script03_2_F044,pig
