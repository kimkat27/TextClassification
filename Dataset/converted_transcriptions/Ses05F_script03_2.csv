Ses05F_script03_2_M000,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
Ses05F_script03_2_F000,You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05F_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.
Ses05F_script03_2_F001,Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05F_script03_2_M002,"I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste."
Ses05F_script03_2_F002,"No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often."
Ses05F_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses05F_script03_2_F003,You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses05F_script03_2_M004,"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?"
Ses05F_script03_2_F004,"maybe just a little, but--"
Ses05F_script03_2_M005,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses05F_script03_2_F005,And what of it?
Ses05F_script03_2_M006,What of it?
Ses05F_script03_2_F006,"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me."
Ses05F_script03_2_M007,What about me?
Ses05F_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious, you never would have heard about it."
Ses05F_script03_2_M008,"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say."
Ses05F_script03_2_F008,I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.
Ses05F_script03_2_M009,"So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?"
Ses05F_script03_2_F009,No.
Ses05F_script03_2_M010,I'll have a little I think.
Ses05F_script03_2_F010,I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.
Ses05F_script03_2_M011,"No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones."
Ses05F_script03_2_F011,"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing."
Ses05F_script03_2_M012,You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.
Ses05F_script03_2_F012,It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05F_script03_2_M013,You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
Ses05F_script03_2_F013,Don't be so stupid.
Ses05F_script03_2_M014,"Really, Amanda."
Ses05F_script03_2_M015,"Going out somewhere, dear?"
Ses05F_script03_2_F014,Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05F_script03_2_M016,"Oh, that reply has broken my heart."
Ses05F_script03_2_F015,It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?
Ses05F_script03_2_M017,"As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true."
Ses05F_script03_2_F016,"No, it's not."
Ses05F_script03_2_M018,"Oh, yes it is."
Ses05F_script03_2_F017,"Oh, Do shut up."
Ses05F_script03_2_M019,It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05F_script03_2_F018,"Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you."
Ses05F_script03_2_M020,"Well, snap, snap, snap like a little adder."
Ses05F_script03_2_F019,"adder don't snap, they sting."
Ses05F_script03_2_M021,"Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap."
Ses05F_script03_2_F020,They sting.
Ses05F_script03_2_M022,They snap.
Ses05F_script03_2_F021,"I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay."
Ses05F_script03_2_M023,[BREATHING]
Ses05F_script03_2_M024,Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
Ses05F_script03_2_F022,"Yes, I did quite a bit."
Ses05F_script03_2_M025,I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
Ses05F_script03_2_F023,Mind your own business.
Ses05F_script03_2_M026,"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway."
Ses05F_script03_2_F024,"Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk."
Ses05F_script03_2_M027,I'm not the least bit drunk.
Ses05F_script03_2_M028,I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.
Ses05F_script03_2_F025,"Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass."
Ses05F_script03_2_M029,"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?"
Ses05F_script03_2_F026,"Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop."
Ses05F_script03_2_M030,"Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots."
Ses05F_script03_2_F027,"Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy."
Ses05F_script03_2_M031,"Oh, very good idea.  I will."
Ses05F_script03_2_F028,Ugh.
Ses05F_script03_2_M032,You better turn that off I think.
Ses05F_script03_2_F029,Why?
Ses05F_script03_2_M033,It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.
Ses05F_script03_2_F030,There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses05F_script03_2_M034,"Well, there are people downstairs I suppose."
Ses05F_script03_2_F031,They're away in Tunis.
Ses05F_script03_2_M035,It is not time of year for Tunis.
Ses05F_script03_2_F032,Turn it on again.
Ses05F_script03_2_M036,I'll do no such thing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F033,"Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent."
Ses05F_script03_2_M037,Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.
Ses05F_script03_2_F034,"Well, do try to control yourself darling."
Ses05F_script03_2_M038,Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_F035,You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.
Ses05F_script03_2_M039,Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_F036,I- I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_M040,Amanda-- Listen- Listen-
Ses05F_script03_2_F037,I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F038,"No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing."
Ses05F_script03_2_M041,Very music- amusing indeed.
Ses05F_script03_2_F039,"Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you."
Ses05F_script03_2_M042,"You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again."
Ses05F_script03_2_F040,"Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous."
Ses05F_script03_2_M043,"Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again."
Ses05F_script03_2_F041,Beast; brute; cad; whore
