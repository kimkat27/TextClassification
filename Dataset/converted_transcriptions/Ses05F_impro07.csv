Ses05F_impro07_M023,"Well, yeah, of course, but you're going to be working on your school stuff too, and partying that takes up a lot of time, right, especially at U.S.C., I hear it's a big party college."

Ses05F_impro07_M029,"living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad."
Ses05F_impro07_F030,[LAUGHTER] by yourself.
Ses05F_impro07_F031,you'd be that kid
Ses05F_impro07_F032,"living near campus, and not going to school."
Ses05F_impro07_M030,"Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much."
