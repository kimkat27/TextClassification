Ses05F_impro08_M014,It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.
Ses05F_impro08_F017,"Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-"
Ses05F_impro08_M015,Wow.  I can't believe you're actually admitting to having a problem on your end.  That's a first.

Ses05F_impro08_M021,Because I paid it on time.
Ses05F_impro08_F023,"Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that."
